                    <p class="left-align">Through Aggie Sisters for Christ, a women’s organization on campus, I have the amazing opportunity to participate in many local service projects throughout the Bryan-College Station area. These projects include Jack’s Project (an organization that meets the needs of children in hospitals throughout Texas), Aggieland Humane Society (a BCS animal shelter), Hope Pregnancy Center (a free pregnancy care clinic in BCS), Save Our Streets (SOS – an organization that aims to keep young kids and teens off of the streets and out of dangerous situations after school), the Salvation Army, and more. In addition, we provide free childcare and discipleship to single Christian mothers in need. </p>

                    <p class="left-align">Freshmen Radiating Eagerness in Serving Humanity is a Freshman Leadership Organization at Texas A&M University. Every year, roughly 15,000 freshman leave home for the first time to come to live on the campus of the largest university in the world. Not only is College Station home to around 70,000 students, but it is also known as one of the universities with the strongest traditions in the country. As a 'big' for the organization, I have the privilege of mentoring a group of freshmen each year. I work to create a home away from home for the new students and teach them the traditions we hold so dearly.
